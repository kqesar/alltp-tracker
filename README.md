## 🎯 How to Use

### Item Tracking
- **Click items** in the left grid to cycle through their states (0-4 for progressive items, on/off for binary items)
- **Visual feedback**: Items show as dimmed when not obtained, bright when obtained
- **Progressive items**: Bow (0-4), Gloves (0-2), Sword (0-4), etc. cycle through upgrade levels

### Map Interaction
- **Chest markers**: Click to mark overworld chests as opened/unopened
- **Boss icons**: Click to mark dungeon bosses as beaten
- **Hover information**: Mouse over any element to see requirements and details

### Boss Overlays
Each dungeon boss has three clickable overlays:
- **Top-right (Medallion)**: For Misery Mire and Turtle Rock, cycle through medallion requirements (Unknown/Bombos/Ether/Quake)
- **Bottom-left (Chest count)**: Track remaining chests in the dungeon
- **Bottom-right (Reward)**: Track the boss reward (Crystal/Pendant type)

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Location/boss is accessible with current items
- **Red**: Not accessible with current items  
- **Yellow**: Partially accessible (some items missing)
- **Dimmed**: Already completed/opened

### Caption System
- **Hover over items** on the map to see detailed requirement information
- **Dynamic medallion info**: Captions for Misery Mire and Turtle Rock update to show the currently selected medallion requirement

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

### Automatic Deployment Process
1. **Trigger**: Push to `master` branch or manual workflow dispatch
2. **Quality Checks**: 
   - ✅ `pnpm lint` - Code quality validation
   - ✅ `pnpm test` - Test suite execution
   - ✅ `pnpm build` - Production build verification
3. **Deploy**: Built assets are automatically pushed to `gh-pages` branch and deployed

### GitHub Pages Configuration
The deployment uses the traditional `gh-pages` branch approach:
- Built assets are pushed to the `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages serves content from the `gh-pages` branch
