## 🎯 How to Use

### Item Tracking
- **Click items** in the left grid to cycle through their states (0-4 for progressive items, on/off for binary items)
- **Visual feedback**: Items show as dimmed when not obtained, bright when obtained
- **Progressive items**: Bow (0-4), Gloves (0-2), Sword (0-4), etc. cycle through upgrade levels

### Map Interaction
- **Chest markers**: Click to mark overworld chests as opened/unopened
- **Boss icons**: Click to mark dungeon bosses as beaten
- **Hover information**: Mouse over any element to see requirements and details

### Boss Overlays
Each dungeon boss has three clickable overlays:
- **Top-right (Medallion)**: For Misery Mire and Turtle Rock, cycle through medallion requirements (Unknown/Bombos/Ether/Quake)
- **Bottom-left (Chest count)**: Track remaining chests in the dungeon
- **Bottom-right (Reward)**: Track the boss reward (Crystal/Pendant type)

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Location/boss is accessible with current items
- **Red**: Not accessible with current items  
- **Yellow**: Partially accessible (some items missing)
- **Dimmed**: Already completed/opened

### Caption System
- **Hover over items** on the map to see detailed requirement information
- **Dynamic medallion info**: Captions for Misery Mire and Turtle Rock update to show the currently selected medallion requirement
